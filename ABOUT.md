# Manage Your Life from One Interface

**Everything you need, right where you're already working.**

Stop switching between apps. Manage your goals, calendar, notes, drawings, and more—all from Cursor or Claude. Just talk to your AI assistant naturally, and it handles everything.

## One Interface, Everything Connected

### Goals & Calendar
- "What's on my calendar this week?"
- "Create a goal to launch the project by March"
- "Add a meeting with Sarah tomorrow at 2pm"
- Goals automatically sync to your Google Calendar

### Notes & Knowledge
- "Create a note about the project ideas we discussed"
- "Show me notes about React patterns"
- "Organize my notes into a Projects folder"
- Full Obsidian vault—your notes stay yours

### Creative Work
- "Create a wireframe for the login page"
- "Add icons from the Google library to my drawing"
- "List all my drawings"
- Access pre-built libraries for icons, diagrams, wireframes

### Memory & Profile
- "Remember that I prefer dark mode interfaces"
- "What achievements have I logged this year?"
- "Update my skills with TypeScript"
- Persistent memory that survives across sessions

### Media & Automation
- "Download this YouTube video"
- "Run my morning routine shortcut"
- "List my available shortcuts"
- Integrate with your existing workflows

## How It Works

Just ask. Your AI assistant understands context and connects everything:

- Create a goal → it appears in your calendar
- Write a note → link it to related goals
- Draw a diagram → reference it in your notes
- Everything stays connected and searchable

No app switching. No context loss. No friction.

## Your Data, Your Control

All data is stored locally in your vault. Your notes, goals, drawings, and profile belong to you. Sync with Google Calendar when you want, but your core data never leaves your machine.

**One interface. Everything connected. That's it.**
